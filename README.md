# biomegen

Biome generator for Minetest, reproducing closely the biome generator provided by Minetest's core, but in Lua.

Made for using the biome system with Lua mapgens (that do no allow to use core biome system).

Reads registered biomes and decorations, so compatible with all mods adding biomes/decos.

API description to be written.
